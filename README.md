# _About_

This project is a template for a shell around an open source project. This about section should be replaced with some text
that describes what your project does.

# _Usage_

Sections in this readme that are marked with _italics_ require review and action when utilizing the template. Additional sections
may be added.

Generally speaking, the LICENSE.txt file, Contributing, and License sections should be left alone. The
CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, CONTRIBUTORS.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, and NOTICE.txt should be left in place but may need to be enhanced
with additional details, and signed with initial contributor names.

Keep in mind that the template is a template, if you think the community around your project would be better served by moving some words around, applying different PR/issue/contribution practices, feel free to do so. If you have a change that you think should be made to the template because you believe it would be universally applicable feel free to issue a PR to the base generator project.

This usage section should be removed or replaced with details around the usage of your project. As a library and/or an
independent functional piece of software.
